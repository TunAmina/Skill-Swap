# Skill-Swap-Project MVP  :heart_eyes:
A platform where users can exchange skills or services. For example, someone who's good at graphic design could swap their skills with someone who can teach them guitar. Users can create profiles, list their skills, and interact with others through likes and comments to arrange skill exchanges.


If you want to swap a skill, then you have to be a user.

Essential platform: User account
1. Create an account with skills (User has to choose skill genre)
2. Post pictures/videos of their skills
3. Add info about their skills and how they can share it (online, though a meet)
4. They can add info about address and location
5. They can edit or delete only their account and their skills
6. They can favorite other users and save their account (BONUS)


Others (Anyone who opens the page):
1. Only can see users account


Design:
1. Home page is showing different genres of skills of all users
2. Login / sign up buttons
3. User page where you can edit, add and delete



At last if we have time we can:
1. Create a filter with location
2. Deactivate account 


Skills Genre:
1. Lifestyle skills (sports /  home stuff / cooking / fashion..)
2. Technical skills (development, motor stuff, computer..)
3. Soft skills  (language, communication, leadership..)
